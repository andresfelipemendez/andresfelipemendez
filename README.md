### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Andres Felipe Mendez Torres**, a Software Developer with a passion for game engine development, dedicated to building software optimized for performance and maintainability. ðŸŽ®âœ¨ 

- ðŸ”­ Currently deep into **100 Dungeons**, where Iâ€™m writing a game engine in a C-style C++ approachâ€”no STL, to avoid exceptions. I'm developing a custom ECS to manually manage a memory buffer, enabling DLL hot reloading for real-time updates.
- ðŸŒ± Continuously learning about **data-oriented design** and **game engine architecture** to push performance and structure.
- ðŸ“« Reach me at: fmendez1212@gmail.com

Letâ€™s bring data-driven performance and design to the next level! ðŸš€
