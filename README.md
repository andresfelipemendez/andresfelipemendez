### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Andres Felipe Mendez**, a Software Developer with a passion for game engine development and systems programming, dedicated to building software optimized for performance and maintainability. 

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on two projects:
  - **100 Dungeons**: A game engine written in C-style C++ (no STL, avoiding exceptions) with a custom ECS for manual memory buffer management and DLL hot reloading capabilities.
  - **Toshokan (å›³æ›¸é¤¨)**: A minimalist PDF reader and digital book library manager built with SDL3 Clay and MuPDF, designed to bring "text editor like" simplicity to PDF management and reading.

- ðŸŒ± Expanding my expertise in **data-oriented design**, **game engine architecture**, and **systems programming** to create high-performance, maintainable software solutions.

- ðŸ“« Reach me at: fmendez1212@gmail.com

Let's bring data-driven performance and design to the next level! ðŸš€
